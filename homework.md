# Homework assignment 1

## Brief:

  Write a piece of code that prints 'Hello World' to the console. You can only use variables that contain 'Hello' and 'World'. _**You may not create a space variable**_, but your code may contain a non-variable space like this ' '.

## Tip:

  This is the program we saw earlier that printed 'HelloWorld':

    var string1 = 'Hello'
    var string2 = 'World'

    console.log(string1 + string2)
    // This 'addition' is the key.
    // More than one thing can be added together..

  It prints this to the console:

    HelloWorld
